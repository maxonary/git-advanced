Git rebase is a command that works by transferring 
the commits of a branch onto another branch. 
It can also be used to modify or even remove commits. 
Specifically, it takes the existing commits on a 
branch and re-applies them onto the current branch head. 
By doing this, you can “replay” the commits onto a new 
branch and make the history look cleaner. 
Rebase is a great way to make sure that a branch 
always has the most up to date commits and can be used 
to help simplify a complicated commit history.
